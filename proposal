Title of the project: Reversi

Type of project: Game Tree Search

Project Description:
Reversi is a two-player board game played on a 8X8 board.
The pieces called “disks” using on the board have one side
in black and the other side in white. Each player
(Player A or Player B) puts disks in the grid with his/her
assigned color on top. At every turn, one player(Player A)
places a disk of his/her color adjacent to one of Player B’s
disks on an unoccupied square on the board, but there must be
one or more of Player B’s disks between the disc(D1) Player A
just placed and another Player A’s disc(D2) on the board already.
Then Player A will flip all Player B’s disks between D1 and D2 to
his/her color. Game is over when neither Player A nor Player B
has a legal move. The winner is the player who has more disks of
his/her color on the board. We will make two modes in this game,
human vs computer_A or computer_A vs computer_B.  A minimax game
tree will be used to show all available legal moves in each turn.
Number of black pieces on the board after each possible legal move
is also labeled on the tree, which is the first heuristic function
value. In addition, at each turn we will set each disk a value
representing the distance between that piece and its closest boundary.
The second heuristic function will return the sum of value for each
pieces belonging to each player after taking any legal move.

Brief evaluation plan:
We will set Computer_A to use heuristic value associated with black
pieces and set Computer_B  to use heuristic value associated with the
total sum of assigned value on the board. Computer_A will make a move
which might lead to the maximum black piece on the board after five
moves while Computer_B will make a move based on maximum value from
the second heuristic function. We will run the game over and over again
to compare the winning time and how many moves made to win for each player.
